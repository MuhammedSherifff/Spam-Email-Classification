his project is a spam email classification system built using Python. It utilizes various machine learning models to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam). The system is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter for user interaction and model evaluation.

Features
Preprocessing: Text data is preprocessed using techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.

Machine Learning Models: The system includes several classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier


Model Evaluation: Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.


GUI: A simple GUI allows users to input text and classify it as spam or ham using the trained models. It also displays model accuracy.
